Technical Coding Problems in Java

Implementing various technical coding problems in java to increase the skills in programming,data structure ,algorithms.
Every Problem is solved by taking care of the time and space complexity and each program complexity is mentioned for the problems.

Problem 1-Find K smallest number in a given array of Size n:

In order to solve problems I have implemented 3 approaches:
  <ol><li>Sorting</li><li>Modified Selection Sorting</li><li>Using Max Heap</li></li></ol>
  
Problem 2-String Manipulation methods
<ol><li>Check if all characters in the string without using any extra buffer</li><li>Reverse the string</li><li>Remove Duplicates</li></li><li>Check if a string is a anagram or not</li></ol>

Problem3- Find the longest subsequence between two strings using Dynamic Programming

Problem4-Find the longest palindrome substring in a given string(max-length=1000).The problem is implemented in two ways :
<ol><li>Using Greedy approach which might turn into timeout </li><li>Using Dynamic programming.</li></ol>

Problem 5: Find the zig zag version of the string when number of rows are passed alongwith the string.(This problem was mentioned in Leetcode) and references for the problem description has been taken from there.
For example: If the string is "PAYPALISHIRING" and number of rows = 3 then output would be PAHNAPLSIIGYI.

zig zag for above string with number of rows would be
 
      P       A       H       N
      A   P   L    S  I   I   G
      Y       I       R 
      
      Thus the output is PAHNAPLSIIGYIR.
      
      For same String with number of rows:
      P           I             N
      A       L   S         I   G
      Y   A       H     R
      P           I 
      
      Hence output string would be PINALSIGYAHRPI
